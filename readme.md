# Ryori Token for Eat-to-Earn $RYO (ICRC1)

## Overview  
The Ryori Token project is designed to create and implement a **fungible token standard** using blockchain and distributed ledger technology. Built with **Motoko**, the project is tailored to work seamlessly with the **DFINITY Internet Computer** platform.  

## What's Included  
- **`dfx.json`**: Configuration file that manages project settings and canister definitions.  
- **`mops.toml`**: A file for dependency management, listing essential Motoko libraries and tools.  
- **`src/Token.mo`**: The heart of the project, containing the source code for the token system written in Motoko.  

## Setup and Installation  

### 1. **Prepare Your Environment**  
Before you get started, make sure your system is ready for Motoko development. This includes installing:  
- [DFINITY Internet Computer SDK](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/references/cli-reference/dfx-parent)  
- [Mops Toolchain](https://docs.mops.one/quick-start)  

### 2. **Install Dependencies**  
Run the following command to set up all required libraries listed in `mops.toml`:  
```bash
mops install
```

### 3. Configure the Project
Adjust settings in dfx.json and mops.toml to fit your needs. This includes updating canister configurations, modifying dependency versions, or other customizations.

## How to Use
###  Development
Dive into the src/Token.mo file to build or modify the logic of the fungible token system.
This is where you can implement new features, customize the token behavior, or make improvements.
Dependencies
The project relies on:

### DFX (DFINITY SDK)
Mops for dependency management
Additional libraries and tools listed in mops.toml. Make sure they're properly installed to avoid issues.
